# Various Volto addons

This are Volto addons or modifications that don't fit a specific purpose but
are generic enough to fit more then one website.

## Naming conventions

Try to group components (Blocks, Views, Widgets) by their big specific idea.
For example, the PlotlyChart folder hosts the Block View, Block Edit and Modal
Chart components.

Name content type views as View.jsx. Name block views as BlockView.jsx, block
edit as BlockEdit.jsx, widgets as Widget.jsx

## Applied configuration by using `config.applyConfig`

- Set the Hidden widget as default widget for the blocks field
